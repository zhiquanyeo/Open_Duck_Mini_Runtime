"""
Shared control bus: lets the phone web UI and the local gamepad drive the robot in
parallel.

The web server (stats_server.py) writes joystick/button intents in from HTTP
handler threads; RLWalk.run() folds them into the SAME command vector + button
edge-detector the gamepad feeds, so both sources share one code path and you can
swap between them freely mid-session.

Merge policy:
  * Sticks: while the web posts `active=True` (and hasn't gone stale) the web axes
    OVERRIDE the gamepad/remote-controller axes; otherwise the pad wins. So
    releasing the on-screen stick (which posts active=False, or simply stops
    posting) hands control straight back to the pad.
  * Triggers: max of the two sources (either can raise an antenna).
  * Buttons: a web "press" becomes a single edge; web "down"/"up" hold across
    ticks (for LB-sprint-style holds). Web is OR-ed with the gamepad's held state
    before edge detection, so `.triggered`/`.is_pressed` work identically no
    matter which source acted.

Unlike the fork this is ported from, telemetry does NOT flow through this bus —
RLWalk.get_telemetry()/get_stats() already publish a thread-safe cached snapshot
the stats server serves directly, so ControlBus only needs to carry the *input*
side (sticks/buttons/trim/settings).

Pure stdlib + thread-safe; no hardware imports, so it unit-tests off-robot.
